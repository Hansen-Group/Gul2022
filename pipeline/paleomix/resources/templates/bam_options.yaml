    # Choice of aligner software to use, either "BWA" or "Bowtie2"
    Program: BWA

    # Settings for mappings performed using BWA
    BWA:
      # One of "backtrack", "bwasw", "mem", or "mem2"; see the BWA documentation
      # for a description of each algorithm (defaults to 'mem')
      Algorithm: mem
      # Filter aligned reads with a mapping quality (Phred) below this value
      MinQuality: 0
      # Filter reads that did not map to the reference sequence
      FilterUnmappedReads: yes
      # Post-mortem damage localizes to the 5' region, which the 'backtrack' algorithm
      # expects to contain few errors. Disabling the seed may therefore improve mapping
      # results for aDNA at the cost of increased runtime (see http://pmid.us/22574660).
      UseSeed: yes
      # Additional command-line options may be specified below. For 'backtrack' these
      # are applied to "bwa aln" calls. See Bowtie2 for more examples.
#      -n: 0.04

    # Settings for mappings performed using Bowtie2
    Bowtie2:
      # Filter aligned reads with a mapping quality (Phred) below this value
      MinQuality: 0
      # Filter reads that did not map to the reference sequence
      FilterUnmappedReads: yes
      # Examples of how to add additional command-line options
#      --trim5: 5
#      --trim3: 5
      # Note that the colon is required, even if no value is specified
      --very-sensitive:
      # Example of how to specify multiple values for an option

  # Command-line options for mapDamage; use long-form options(--length not -l):
  mapDamage:
    # By default, the pipeline will downsample the input to 100k hits
    # when running mapDamage; remove to use all hits
    --downsample: 100000

  # Set to 'yes' exclude a type of trimmed reads from alignment / analysis;
  # possible read-types reflect the output of AdapterRemoval
  ExcludeReads:
    # Exclude single-end reads (yes / no)?
    Single: no
    # Exclude non-collapsed paired-end reads (yes / no)?
    Paired: no
    # Exclude paired-end reads for which the mate was discarded (yes / no)?
    Singleton: no
    # Exclude overlapping paired-ended reads collapsed into a single sequence
    # by AdapterRemoval (yes / no)?
    Collapsed: no
    # Like 'Collapsed', but only for collapsed reads truncated due to the
    # presence of ambiguous or low quality bases at read termini (yes / no).
    CollapsedTruncated: no

  # Optional steps to perform during processing.
  Features:
    # If set to 'filter', PCR duplicates are removed from the output files; if set to
    # 'mark', PCR duplicates are flagged with bit 0x400, and not removed from the
    # output files; if set to 'no', the reads are assumed to not have been amplified.
    PCRDuplicates: filter
    # Set to 'no' to disable mapDamage; set to 'plot' to build basic mapDamage plots;
    # set to 'model' to build plots and post-mortem damage models; and set to 'rescale'
    # to build plots, models, and BAMs with rescaled quality scores. All analyses are
    # carried out per library.
    mapDamage: no
    # Generate coverage information for the final BAM and for each 'RegionsOfInterest'
    # specified in 'Prefixes' (yes / no).
    Coverage: yes
    # Generate histograms of number of sites with a given read-depth, from 0 to 200,
    # for each BAM and for each 'RegionsOfInterest' specified in 'Prefixes' (yes / no).
    Depths: yes
    # Generate summary table for each target (yes / no)
