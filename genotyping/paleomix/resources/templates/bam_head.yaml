# Default options.
# Can also be specific for a set of samples, libraries, and lanes,

Options:
  # Sequencing platform, see SAM/BAM reference for valid values
  Platform: Illumina
  # Quality offset for Phred scores, either 33 (Sanger/Illumina 1.8+)
  # or 64 (Illumina 1.3+ / 1.5+). For Bowtie2 it is also possible to
  # specify 'Solexa', to handle reads on the Solexa scale. This is
  # used during adapter-trimming and sequence alignment
  QualityOffset: 33

  # Settings for trimming of reads, see AdapterRemoval man-page
  AdapterRemoval:
     # Uncomment to override defaults adapter sequences
